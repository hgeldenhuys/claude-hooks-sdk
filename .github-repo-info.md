# GitHub Repository Setup

To complete the setup, create a GitHub repository:

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `claude-hooks-sdk`
3. Description: `Type-safe TypeScript SDK for building Claude Code hook extensions`
4. Public repository
5. Do NOT initialize with README (we already have one)

Then connect and push:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/hgeldenhuys/claude-hooks-sdk.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main --tags
```
